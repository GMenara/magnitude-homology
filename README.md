# Magnitude Homology Calculations

Code for graph magnitude homology calculations.
- "MH using sage.ipynb" contains the py3 version of the code implemented by Simon Willerton and James Cranch. Code is implemented in Sagemath 9.3 (based on Python 3.9).
- "src" directory contains the py3 code to compute graph MH: "create_graph" draws the considered graph, "boundary_matrix" builds MC_{k-1,l} and MC{k,l}, in "main" we specify the hyperparameters G, k, l.
